Use a normal class and not extend from junit.framework.TestCase.
Use the Test annotation to mark a method as a test method. 
To use the Test annotation, we need to import org.junit.Test
Use one of the assert methods. There is no difference between 
the old assert methods and the new assert methods. An easy way 
to use the assert method is to do a static import as shown by 
point 2 in the code above.
Run the test using JUnit4TestAdapter. If you want to learn more
about JUnit4TestAdapter, keep reading ahead.

Run the tests

Unfortunately, our favorite development environments are still 
unaware of JUnit 4. JUnit4Adapter enables compatibility with the 
old runners so that the new JUnit 4 tests can be run with the old runners. 
The suite method in the diagram above illustrates the use of JUnit4Adapter.
Alternatively, you can use the JUnitCore class in the org.junit.runner 
package. JUnit 4 runner can also run tests written using the old JUnit. 
To run the tests using the JUnitCore class via the command line, type:

java org.junit.runner.JUnitCore LibraryTest

Set up and tear down

The new JUnit provides two new annotations for set up and tear down:

@Before: Method annotated with @Before executes before every test.
@After: Method annotated with @After executes after every test.
